Some notes/points that may need to be configured:
(1) Will re-buy membership at 1d left to avoid becoming a non-member. Will use nMule to provide coins.
(2) Currently sells all items except 3000 death/chaos rune and 250 blood runes. Adjust as desired
(3) Buys enough supplies for 30-40 runs. This makes several assumptions about potion and food usage, so numbers are not perfect.
(4) Mules off all but 500k.
(5) Currently buys prayer and ranging potions only. Add others to buy list if needed (decanting is already set up for all Barrows potions)
(6) Currently buys monkfish as food
(7) Add correct ammo for buying (current Rune arrow x 3000) 
(7) For Starting the barrows script, you need to put in the argument for your pre-sets and also set a stop condition on the run script task
